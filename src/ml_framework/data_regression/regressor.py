    The Regressor class performs three main functions:
        - Fit: a function that takes the training set and the name of the needed model as input and trains the model.
        - Predict: a function that takes a testing set and predicts the output.
        - Score: a function that takes two sets: one for input features and the other for their true outputs. 
                The function also takes an argument called metric to decide what to return of different regression metrics.
